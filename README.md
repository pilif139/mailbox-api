# Mailbox API

This is my mailbox api project.

It's made with typescript, nodejs and express framework. For database i choosed mongoDB to learn NoSQL and mongoose ODM for integration with it .It uses JWT tokens stored in cookies for authentication.

I plant to make a frontend app for this api and a golang or other programming language chrono system notifier.
